Among these four properties, with the help of isolation, the database can determine 
how the transaction integrity is visible to the system and the user.

Hereâ€™s a concise comparison of DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE in SQL:

1. DELETE
Purpose: Removes specific rows from a table based on a condition.
Usage: Includes a WHERE clause to filter rows.
Impact: Only deletes data; table structure remains intact.
Rollback: Supports rollback (transaction-safe).
Performance: Slower for large datasets as it logs each row deletion.
Example:
Sql

Copy code
DELETE FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
2. DROP
Purpose: Deletes the entire table (data + structure).
Usage: Removes the table permanently.
Impact: Completely removes the table and its metadata.
Rollback: Cannot be rolled back.
Performance: Fast, as it removes the table directly.
Example:
Sql

Copy code
DROP TABLE employees;
3. TRUNCATE
Purpose: Removes all rows from a table but retains the structure.
Usage: Clears the table without logging individual row deletions.
Impact: Resets table data but keeps the table for reuse.
Rollback: Cannot be rolled back in most databases.
Performance: Faster than DELETE for clearing all rows.
Example:
Sql

Copy code
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
