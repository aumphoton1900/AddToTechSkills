set 

1]EnumSet
 it will never throw ConcurrentModificationException.
 Null elements are not permitted.
 Set<MyEnum> s = Collections.synchronizedSet(EnumSet.noneOf(MyEnum.class));

EnumSet is an abstract class and it provides two concrete implementations, java.util.RegularEnumSet and java.util.JumboEnumSet. 
The main difference between RegularEnumSet and 
JumboEnumSet is that the former uses a long variable to store elements while later uses a long[] to store its element. 

Since RegularEnumSet uses a long variable, which is a 64-bit data type, it can only hold that much of an element. 

That's why when an empty EnumSet is created using EnumSet.noneOf() method, it chooses RegularEnumSet 
if the key universe (number of enum instances in Key Enum) 
is less than or equal to 64 and JumboEnumSet if the key universe is more than 64.

3]sortedSet vs NavigableSet 
----------------------------
Methods lower(E), return elements respectively less than
floor(E),  less than or equal
ceiling(E), , greater than or equal
higher(E)  greater than a given element.

return elements respectively less than, less than or equal, greater than or equal, and 
greater than a given element, returning null if there is no such element.

A SortedSet extended with navigation methods reporting closest matches for given search targets.

---------
SortedSet<E>	headSet​(E toElement)	
Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are strictly less than toElement.
NavigableSet<E>	headSet​(E toElement, boolean inclusive)	
Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are less than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) toElement.

SortedSet<E>	tailSet​(E fromElement)	
Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement.
NavigableSet<E>	tailSet​(E fromElement, boolean inclusive)	
Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) fromElement.
