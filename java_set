1]EnumSet
 it will never throw ConcurrentModificationException.
 Null elements are not permitted.
 Set<MyEnum> s = Collections.synchronizedSet(EnumSet.noneOf(MyEnum.class));

EnumSet is an abstract class and it provides two concrete implementations, java.util.RegularEnumSet and java.util.JumboEnumSet. 
The main difference between RegularEnumSet and 
JumboEnumSet is that the former uses a long variable to store elements while later uses a long[] to store its element. 

Since RegularEnumSet uses a long variable, which is a 64-bit data type, it can only hold that much of an element. 

That's why when an empty EnumSet is created using EnumSet.noneOf() method, it chooses RegularEnumSet 
if the key universe (number of enum instances in Key Enum) 
is less than or equal to 64 and JumboEnumSet if the key universe is more than 64.
