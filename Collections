Set
=========
1. how HashSet , LinkedhashSet work internally in java ? [javaconceptoftheday]
2. how linkedhashSet maintain insertion order in java ?

To maintain the order of insertion we need 2 more pointers at every 
Node(besides the next pointer required for LinkedList functionality). 
So besides this linkedList, another doubly-linked-list is also maintained 
in the hashmap which is used to handle the insertion order.
So the LinkedHashMap Node(named LinkedHashMapEntry) will look like:
