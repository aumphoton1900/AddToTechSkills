Set
=========
1. how HashSet , LinkedhashSet work internally in java ? [javaconceptoftheday]
2. how linkedhashSet maintain insertion order in java ?
  each key,value pair are instances of Map.Entry in java 
  insertion order are maintained by adding two new fields to this class
 Class Entry<K,V>  extends HashMap.Entry<K,V> {
  Entry<k,v> before,after.
 }
 // a doubly linkedlist.

To maintain the order of insertion we need 2 more pointers at every 
Node(besides the next pointer required for LinkedList functionality). 
So besides this linkedList, another doubly-linked-list is also maintained 
in the hashmap which is used to handle the insertion order.
So the LinkedHashMap Node(named LinkedHashMapEntry) will look like:


Queue
=======
1. a ds where elements are added from one end tail of queue , removed (head).
 PriorityQueue , ArrayDeque,LinkedList.
