A Maven artifact is a fundamental concept in Apache Maven, a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. 
An artifact is essentially an output generated after a Maven project build. 
This output can be a JAR, WAR, or any other executable file.

Key Elements of a Maven Artifact

Maven artifacts are identified by a set of coordinates, which include the following elements:

groupId: This is the identifier of the group or organization that produces the project. 
It follows the same naming rules as Java packages, typically starting with a reversed domain name you control, 
such as org.apache.maven.

artifactId: This is the name of the project. It is used to construct the artifact's final name and 
should ideally be short and descriptive. For example, commons-lang3 under the groupId org.apache.commons.

version: This specifies the current version of the project. 
Maven supports different version specifications, including releases and snapshots. 
A release artifact indicates a stable version, while a snapshot artifact indicates an ongoing development version.

packaging: This element specifies the type of artifact generated by the project, such as JAR, WAR, or ZIP. 
It defines the goals to execute during the project's lifecycle.

classifier: This is an optional element used for technical reasons when 
delivering the same code as several separate artifacts. For example, 
you might have different classifiers for source code and JavaDoc.

3. lifecycle 
Maven build life cycles are listed below as follows:

Clean: Removes the artifacts produced from the preceding build processes.
Default: The Deployment and build process is taken care of.
Site: Project documentation is carried out in this cycle.
