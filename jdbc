Types of Statements in JDBC
Last Updated : 15 Sep, 2025
In Java, the Statement interface in JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is used to create and execute SQL queries in Java applications. JDBC provides three types of statements to interact with the database:

Statement -> For executing static SQL queries.
PreparedStatement -> For executing parameterized queries.
CallableStatement -> For executing stored procedures.

ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE is a constant defined in the java.sql.ResultSet interface in JDBC 
(Java Database Connectivity). 
It represents a specific type of ResultSet object with the following characteristics:
Scrollable: Unlike TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY ResultSets, TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE allows for navigation both forward and 
backward through the rows of the result set. This includes moving to specific rows, 
moving relative to the current position, and checking for the first or last row.
Insensitive to Database Changes: This type of ResultSet is insensitive 
to changes made to the underlying data in the database after the ResultSet has been created. 
If another transaction modifies or deletes rows that are part of the ResultSet, 
these changes will not be reflected in the TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE object. 
The ResultSet essentially holds a snapshot of the data at the time it was generated.
