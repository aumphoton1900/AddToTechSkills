1.default V compute​(K key, BiFunction<? super K,​? super V,​? extends V> remappingFunction)
Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current mapped value 
(or null if there is no current mapping). For example, to either create or append a String msg to a value mapping:
 
 map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
(Method merge() is often simpler to use for such purposes.)
If the remapping function returns null, the mapping is removed (or remains absent if initially absent). 
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.
The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.
return new value
2.
Integer computeIfPresent(String key, BiFunction<? super String, ? super Integer, ? extends Integer> remappingFunction)
default V computeIfPresent(K key,BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, 
attempts tocompute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value. 
If the function returns null, the mapping is removed. 
If thefunction itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception isrethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.
