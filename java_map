1.default V compute​(K key, BiFunction<? super K,​? super V,​? extends V> remappingFunction)
Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current mapped value 
(or null if there is no current mapping). For example, to either create or append a String msg to a value mapping:
 
 map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
(Method merge() is often simpler to use for such purposes.)
If the remapping function returns null, the mapping is removed (or remains absent if initially absent). 
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.
The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.
return new value

--> you can add new key and value if fun not throw nullpointer expection

2.
Integer computeIfPresent(String key, BiFunction<? super String, ? super Integer, ? extends Integer> remappingFunction)
default V computeIfPresent(K key,BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, 
attempts tocompute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value. 
If the function returns null, the mapping is removed. 
If thefunction itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception isrethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

Map<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();
		scores.put("Alice", 100);
		scores.put("Bob", 85);
		scores.put("null", 85);
		scores.put("null", 85);
{Bob=85, null=85, Alice=100}

3. 
default V computeIfAbsent(K key,Function<? super K,? extends V> mappingFunction)
If the specified key is not already associated with a value 
(or is mapped to null), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless null.

How it works:
The method first checks if the key exists in the map and if its associated value is not null.
If the key is present and its value is not null, the existing value is returned, and the mappingFunction is not executed.
If the key is absent (not in the map) or its associated value is null, 
    the mappingFunction is executed with the key as its argument.
The value returned by the mappingFunction is then associated with the key in the map, 
    unless the mappingFunction returns null, in which case no mapping is recorded.
The method returns the new value associated with the key (either the newly computed value or the existing non-null value).

4. replace 
default boolean replace​(K key, V oldValue, V newValue)
Replaces the entry for the specified key only if currently mapped to the specified value.

default V replace​(K key, V value)
Replaces the entry for the specified key only if it is currently mapped to some value.

5. remove 
   V	remove​(Object key)	
Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present (optional operation).

default boolean	remove​(Object key, Object value)
Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present (optional operation). 



   Map<String, String> myMap = new HashMap<>();
        myMap.put("fruit", "apple");
        myMap.put("color", "red");
     
        myMap.put("color1", "red");
        myMap.put("color1", "red1");
        myMap.put("color2", "red2");
        
      String s =   myMap.remove("color1");
      System.out.println( " == >  "+ s );  
      
        System.out.println("Original Map: " + myMap); // Output: Original Map: {color=red, fruit=apple}

        // Attempt to remove "fruit" only if its value is "apple"
        boolean removed1 = myMap.remove("fruit", "apple");
        System.out.println("Removed 'fruit' (value 'apple'): " + removed1); // Output: Removed 'fruit' (value 'apple'): true
        System.out.println("Map after first removal: " + myMap); // Output: Map after first removal: {color=red}

        // Attempt to remove "color" only if its value is "blue" (will fail)
        boolean removed2 = myMap.remove("color", "blue");
        System.out.println("Removed 'color' (value 'blue'): " + removed2); // Output: Removed 'color' (value 'blue'): false
        System.out.println("Map after second removal: " + myMap); // Output: Map after second removal: {color=red}
