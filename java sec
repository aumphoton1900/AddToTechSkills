keytool -genkeypair -alias <alias> -keypass <keypass> -validity <validity> -storepass <storepass>

keytool used for key management , certificate. (creation , modification , deletion).
store & protect keys (private keys , public keys , secret keys) & certificate using keystore.
keystore a db file , that keytool uses , to store keys certificates.
trustStore store all trusted CA certificates. they never contain private key or secret key.
   -rule certificate from trusted certificate authority such as  digicert , entrust

type of keystore 
- JKS (java key store - store private keys and certificates ,should not be used in production)
- JCEKS java cryptography extension ks
           default keystore for java.
- PKCS#12 - can be used with non java application . may use des-3 ,aes algorithm.
- PKCS#11
- windows-my/windows-root
- 3rd party keystore (bouncy castle / iaik) - bouncy castle ,


Unique identifier for a digital certificate
Definition and Purpose
A certificate fingerprint, also known as a thumbprint, is a hash value that uniquely identifies a digital certificate. 
It is not part of the certificate itself but is computed from the certificate's 
data using cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-1, SHA-256, or MD5. 
This fingerprint serves several important purposes:
Verification: It allows users and systems to verify the authenticity of a certificate. 
If even a small change is made to the certificate, the fingerprint will change completely, 
indicating that the certificate may have been altered or is not valid.
Identification: The fingerprint acts as a unique identifier for the certificate, 
making it easier to manage and organize certificates, especially in environments with multiple certificates.

$keytool -genseckey -alias myAesKey -keytool -keyalg AES -keysize 256 -keystore mystore.jce -storetype jceks 
$keytool -importkeystore -src keystore  /home/auser/.keystore -destkeystore  /home/auser/.keysotre -dest storetype pkcs12"

Q2 : how to generate keys and store them in keystore ?
$keytool -genkey 
it will generate a key pair along with a self signed certificate. 
it will generate key store in home directory. 

#keytool --list -rfc 
will generate certificate in pem format.

In Java, authentication can be achieved through several methods, 
including basic authentication (username/password), 
token-based authentication (JWT), and 
certificate-based authentication (SSL/TLS).

Additionally, Java supports multi-factor authentication, 
OAuth 2.0, and biometric authentication.
These methods can be implemented using various 
frameworks like Spring Security or the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS).
