In Java, authentication can be achieved through several methods, 
including basic authentication (username/password), 
token-based authentication (JWT), and 
certificate-based authentication (SSL/TLS).

Additionally, Java supports multi-factor authentication, 
OAuth 2.0, and biometric authentication.
These methods can be implemented using various 
frameworks like Spring Security or the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS).
