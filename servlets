web.xml -> applicationContext.xml -> spring-servlet.xml 

Example:
web. xml defines mappings between URL paths and the servlets that handle requests with those paths. 
The web server uses this configuration to identify the servlet to handle a given request and call the class 
method that corresponds to the request method. For example: the doGet() method for HTTP GET requests.


when developing a j2ee (web) application , you declare contextloaderlistener in web.xml 
also a contextConfigLocation is also defined to indicate the xml configuration file.

applicationContext.xml : to create a web application object . 
spring-servlet.xml : act as front controller servlet and provide a single point entry .
                 take in incoming url , uses hanlermapping to  define a mapping between 
                 requests and handler objects.

2.1 
ContextLoaderListener vs DispatcherServlet
ContextLoaderListener adds the web application's root context to the ServletContext after creating it. 
Depending on the controller layer technology 
(Sprouts or Spring MVC), this context can be used to load and unload the beans that are handled by Spring.

2.2 
Loading	The file applicationContext.xml is loaded by ContextLoaderListener.	
The file spring-servlet.xml is loaded by DispatcherServlet.
