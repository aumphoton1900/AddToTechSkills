newSingleThreadExecutor() vs newFixedThreadPool(1)
Main difference between the two is the type of queue used. newSingleThreadExecutor() uses an unbounded queue, 
while Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1) uses a fixed-size queue. If the application submits many tasks to the thread pool,
the unbounded queue of newSingleThreadExecutor() can lead to out-of-memory errors, 
while the fixed-size queue of Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1) prevents the number of queued tasks from exceeding a certain limit.

4.CompletableFuture 
CompletableFuture is a class introduced in Java 8 that allows us to write asynchronous, non-blocking code. 

A Future is used as a reference to the result of an asynchronous computation. 
It provides an isDone() method to check whether the computation is done or not, 
and a get() method to retrieve the result of the computation when it is done.

- Running asynchronous computation using runAsync() -
  If you want to run some background task asynchronously and don’t want to return anything from the task, 
  then you can use CompletableFuture.runAsync() method. 
  It takes a Runnable object and returns CompletableFuture<Void>.
- Run a task asynchronously and return the result using supplyAsync() -
- CompletableFuture.supplyAsync() is your companion. 
   It takes a Supplier<T> and returns CompletableFuture<T> where 
   T is the type of the value obtained by calling the given supplier -
   A Supplier<T> is a simple functional interface which represents a supplier of results. 
   It has a single get() method where you can write your background task and return the result.

// Variations of runAsync() and supplyAsync() methods
static CompletableFuture<Void>	runAsync(Runnable runnable)
static CompletableFuture<Void>	runAsync(Runnable runnable, Executor executor)
static <U> CompletableFuture<U>	supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier)
static <U> CompletableFuture<U>	supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier, Executor executor)

You can attach a callback to the CompletableFuture using thenApply(), thenAccept() and thenRun() methods -

You can also write a sequence of transformations on the CompletableFuture by attaching a series of 
thenApply() callback methods. The result of one thenApply() method is passed to the next in the series -

CompletableFuture<String> welcomeText = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return "Rajeev";
}).thenApply(name -> {
    return "Hello " + name;
}).thenApply(greeting -> {
    return greeting + ", Welcome to the CalliCoder Blog";
});

These methods are consumers and are often used as the last callback in the callback chain.

CompletableFuture.thenAccept() takes a Consumer<T> and returns CompletableFuture<Void>. 
It has access to the result of the CompletableFuture on which it is attached.

// thenAccept() example
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
	return ProductService.getProductDetail(productId);
}).thenAccept(product -> {
	System.out.println("Got product detail from remote service " + product.getName())
});

====================================================================================================
Java Concurrency API defines the following three executor interfaces that covers everything that 
is needed for creating and managing threads -

Executor - A simple interface that contains a method called execute() to launch a task specified by a Runnable object.

ExecutorService - A sub-interface of Executor that adds functionality to manage the lifecycle of the tasks. 
It also provides a submit() method whose overloaded versions can accept a Runnable as well as a Callable object. 
Callable objects are similar to Runnable except that the task specified by a Callable object can also return a value. 
We’ll learn about Callable in more detail, in the next blog post.

ScheduledExecutorService - A sub-interface of ExecutorService. It adds functionality to schedule the execution of the tasks.
Apart from the above three interfaces, The API also provides an Executors class that contains 
factory methods for creating different kinds of executor services.
