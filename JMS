In the topic post, I also mentioned that records remain in the topic even after being consumed. 
This allows multiple consumers to consume the same message, but it also allows one more thing: 
the same consumer can re-consume the records it already read, by simply rewinding its consumer offset.
This is very useful when you e.g. had a bug in your consumer and want to re-read the records after fixing the bug.
