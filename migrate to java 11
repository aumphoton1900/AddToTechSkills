In the Oracle release notes for Java 11, I found this:

other-libs ➜ JEP 320 Remove the Java EE and CORBA Modules

Remove the Java EE and CORBA modules from the Java SE Platform and the JDK. 
These modules were deprecated in Java SE 9 with the declared intent to remove them in a future release (JEP 320).

The following modules have been removed from Java SE 11 and JDK 11:

java.xml.ws (JAX-WS, plus the related technologies SAAJ and Web Services Metadata)
java.xml.bind (JAXB) 
...etc

According to what I read from Oracle, they removed Jax-WS from Java 11, 
but it's still available under OpenJDK: JEP 320: Remove the Java EE and CORBA Modules. According to that page,

This proposal assumes that developers who wish to compile or run applications on 
the latest JDK can find and deploy alternate versions of the Java EE technologies. 
The Reference Implementations (RIs) of JAX-WS and JAXB are a good starting point 
because they are complete replacements for the java.xml.ws and java.xml.bind modules in JDK 9. 
The RIs are available as Maven artifacts: (note that they must be deployed on the class path)

com.sun.xml.ws : jaxws-ri (JAX-WS, plus SAAJ and Web Services Metadata)
com.sun.xml.bind : jaxb-ri (JAXB)
The tools for JAX-WS and JAXB are also available as Maven artifacts:

wsgen and wsimport: com.sun.xml.ws : jaxws-tools, plus tool scripts
schemagen and xjc: com.sun.xml.bind : jaxb-jxc and com.sun.xml.bind : jaxb-xjc, plus tool scripts
Since you are on Java 8, you may still have to do more tweaking and/or migrate up to Java 9 first, 
but from I can tell, this is your only path forward.

So to summarize, Oracle removed Jax-WS and related technologies from Java 11, 
but they are still available to download and use and here is the link to the Maven repo for (RIs) of JAX-WS and JAXB .

steps to migrate 
migrating-from-jdk-8-to-jdk-11-for-jax-ws-libraries

Migrating a Java application using JAX-WS libraries from JDK 8 to JDK 11 primarily involves addressing the removal of Java EE modules, including JAX-WS and JAXB, from the core JDK.
Key Steps for Migration:
Update Dependencies:
JAX-WS and JAXB, previously bundled with JDK 8, are no longer part of JDK 11. You need to explicitly add them as external dependencies to your project.
For Maven projects, add the necessary JAX-WS and JAXB runtime and API dependencies. For example:
Code

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sun.xml.ws</groupId>
            <artifactId>jaxws-rt</artifactId>
            <version>2.3.5</version> <!-- Use a compatible version -->
        </dependency>

       <dependency>
            <groupId>jakarta.xml.bind</groupId>
            <artifactId>jakarta.xml.bind-api</artifactId>
            <version>2.3.3</version> <!-- Use a compatible version -->
        </dependency>

Update Build Tools and Plugins:
Ensure your Maven or Gradle version supports JDK 11.
Update relevant plugins like the Maven Compiler Plugin to target Java 11

        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.8.1</version> <!-- Or a newer version -->
            <configuration>
                <source>11</source>
                <target>11</target>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>

Ensure all other third-party libraries and frameworks used in your project are also updated to versions compatible with JDK 11.

----------------------

Compile and Resolve Issues:
Update your build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle) and their respective plugins to versions compatible with JDK 11. 
For Maven, update the maven-compiler-plugin to target Java 11.

Compile your application with JDK 11.
Address any compilation errors related to removed APIs, deprecated packages, or unofficial access to internal APIs. 
The jdeps and jdeprscan tools can help identify potential issues.

Address Runtime Issues:
Run your application with JDK 11.
Monitor for runtime errors or warnings, especially those related to class loading or reflective access.
If using internal APIs (e.g., sun.misc.Unsafe), consider migrating to supported alternatives like Variable 
Handles introduced in later JDK versions.
Consider Modularization (Optional but Recommended):

While not strictly required for running on JDK 11, consider modularizing your application using the Java Module System (Jigsaw) 
for better encapsulation and maintainability in the long run. This can be done incrementally.
Important Considerations:
Iterative Process:
Migration is often an iterative process. Start by getting the application to run on JDK 11, then address compilation and runtime 
issues, and finally consider modularization.

Testing:
Thoroughly test your application after migration to ensure all functionalities work 

=====================
With the release of Java 11, several Java EE (now Jakarta EE) and CORBA modules were removed from the Java Development Kit (JDK). 
This change was introduced in Java 9 by JEP 320: Remove the CORBA and Java EE Modules and fully executed in JDK 11.

The primary modules and their associated packages that were removed are:

java.xml.bind: Contains the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) APIs.

Packages: javax.xml.bind.*
java.xml.ws: Contains the Java API for XML-Based Web Services (JAX-WS) APIs.

Packages: javax.xml.ws.*, javax.xml.soap.*, javax.xml.ws.handler.*
java.activation: Contains the JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) APIs, often used by JAX-WS and JAXB.

Packages: javax.activation.*
java.xml.ws.annotation: Contains annotations used by JAX-WS.

Packages: javax.jws.*, javax.xml.ws.annotation.*
java.corba: Contains the CORBA APIs.

Packages: org.omg.CORBA.*, javax.rmi.CORBA.*, etc.
java.transaction: Contains the Java Transaction API (JTA).

Packages: javax.transaction.*, javax.transaction.xa.*
Although not strictly removed from the JDK in the same way, classes under javax.annotation (Common Annotations) 
are also part of Java EE and are often discussed in this context. While the API still exists, its binding might require an explicit dependency.

Impact and Migration in Google3:

If your application, when migrating from Java 8 to Java 11 (or later Google JDK versions like JDK 21), 
uses classes from these packages, you will encounter ClassNotFoundException or similar errors. 
To resolve this, you need to add explicit dependencies to your BUILD file, pointing to the third-party libraries that provide these APIs.

Here are some common //third_party/java dependencies:

For javax.xml.bind.*: //third_party/java/jaxb
For javax.xml.ws.*: //third_party/java/jaxws
For javax.activation.*: //third_party/java/activation
For javax.annotation.*: //third_party/java/javax_annotation_api

as expected and there are no regressions in behavior.
